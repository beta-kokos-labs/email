If you prefer to set up the email service without relying on an external API key, you can skip the automated DNS configuration step. Instead, you’ll manually configure your DNS records in your domain registrar (e.g., setting up MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records) and proceed with the rest of the automated setup. Here’s a fully self-contained setup without any API keys.

### Full Setup Process Without DNS API Configuration

This solution focuses on:
1. Installing and configuring Postfix.
2. Setting up Postfix to forward emails to a Python script.
3. Configuring an HTTP server to receive and process the email content.

### 1. Install and Configure Postfix

Use Python to install and configure Postfix as an internet site to handle incoming emails. This will be similar to the previous approach but will skip the DNS automation.

```python
import subprocess

def install_postfix():
    # Update system and install Postfix
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "apt", "update"], check=True)
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "apt", "install", "-y", "postfix"], check=True)

    # Configure Postfix to act as an internet site for receiving emails
    with open("/etc/postfix/main.cf", "a") as postfix_config:
        postfix_config.write("\nmyhostname = mail.yourdomain.com\n")
        postfix_config.write("mydomain = yourdomain.com\n")
        postfix_config.write("mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost\n")

    # Reload Postfix to apply changes
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", "postfix"], check=True)

install_postfix()
```

### Manual DNS Configuration

**In your domain registrar:**
1. **MX Record**: Point to `mail.yourdomain.com` with a low priority number (e.g., 10).
2. **SPF Record**: Create a TXT record to specify allowed mail servers: `v=spf1 mx ~all`.
3. (Optional) **DKIM and DMARC**: To improve email deliverability, configure DKIM and DMARC if you’re familiar with their setup.

These records help your email server handle incoming mail reliably and prevent spam issues.

### 2. Configure Postfix to Forward Emails to a Python Script

Next, configure Postfix to forward emails to a Python processing script. This script will parse incoming email content and forward it to a web endpoint.

#### Script: Email Processing Script
Create a script at `/usr/local/bin/process_email.py` to process the email content and send it to a URL.

```python
import sys
import requests

def forward_email():
    # Read email content from stdin
    email_content = sys.stdin.read()

    # Send the email content to a web server endpoint
    response = requests.post(
        "https://your-web-server-url.com/email-webhook",
        data=email_content,
        headers={"Content-Type": "text/plain"}
    )
    print("Email forwarded:", response.status_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    forward_email()
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/process_email.py
```

#### Update Postfix Aliases in Python
The Python script below will update `/etc/aliases` to forward emails to your `process_email.py` script.

```python
import subprocess

def update_aliases():
    with open("/etc/aliases", "a") as alias_file:
        alias_file.write("incoming: \"|/usr/local/bin/process_email.py\"\n")
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "newaliases"], check=True)

update_aliases()
```

### 3. Deploy a Flask Web Server to Process Incoming Email Content

This web server will receive and process the forwarded email content.

#### Flask Web Server Script
This Flask app listens on `/email-webhook` for incoming email data and can log, store, or route it further as needed.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/email-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def email_webhook():
    # Get the raw email content sent from the Postfix processing script
    email_content = request.data.decode('utf-8')

    # Process the email as needed (e.g., log, forward, store)
    print("Received Email:", email_content)

    return {"status": "success"}, 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

#### Deploy the Flask Web Server

You can deploy this Flask app using any hosting provider or platform (e.g., Render, Heroku, DigitalOcean) or run it on the same server as Postfix if appropriate.

### 4. Combined Automation Script

This final Python script will install and configure Postfix, set up email aliases, and guide you to manually configure DNS records:

```python
def setup_email_service():
    print("Installing and configuring Postfix...")
    install_postfix()
    print("Updating email forwarding aliases...")
    update_aliases()
    print("Setup complete. Please configure your DNS records manually as follows:")
    print("\n1. MX Record: Point to 'mail.yourdomain.com' with priority 10.")
    print("2. SPF Record: Set as 'v=spf1 mx ~all'.")
    print("3. (Optional) DKIM and DMARC for improved deliverability.\n")
    print("Your email server is now ready to receive and process incoming emails.")

setup_email_service()
```

### Additional Tips
- **Security**: Ensure that your mail server is secured, as open mail servers can become targets for spam or malicious activity.
- **Testing**: After configuring everything, send test emails to confirm the setup works correctly.
- **Logging**: Add logging to your scripts to help with troubleshooting and debugging.

This approach allows you to handle everything on your own server, avoiding the need for any third-party API. Remember to monitor your server closely and keep it updated to maintain security and deliverability.
